I have nearly 30 years of tech experience in Web Development, Web Design, Digital Graphics, and Manual QA Testing. My past includes being self-employed as a Freelance designer/developer, being among the first employees at a successful startup, and working for a Fortune 500 company. I've spent most of my time in the online advertising industry.

Recently I graduated from a coding bootcamp to hone my modern full stack web development skills to further enhance my ability to seamlessly integrate the front-end into the back-end.

If you're looking for an old(er) team member, with a lot of diverse ability and experience, who just went back to school because he loves what he does and wants to keep improving, please let me know.
